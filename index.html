        <p>
          Over several decades that span the heart of the 20th century, the
          magazine — calling itself, LIFE — published many of the World’s most
          memorable photographs ever taken, documenting political and cultural
          events, as well as famous celebrities who helped shape our modern
          world. Our TIME LIFE collection brings together some of the most
          iconic of these images, including Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous photo of
          a nurse in her sailor’s arms, snapped on August 14th, 1945, as they
          celebrated Victory over Japan Day in Times Square, New York City.<br /><br />
